        "\n",
        "Why fine-tune a Small Language Model (SLM)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because we want small model for a specific task (e.g. don't to pay API credits or leak our data online).\n",
        "\n",
        "If we have our own model... we can run it anywhere and everywhere we like.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to fine-tune an LLM model\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several ways to fine-tune an LLM including reinforcement learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT).\n",
        "\n",
        "We are going to do SFT because it's the most straightforward.\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically SFT = give samples of inputs and outputs and the model learns to map a given input to a given output.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example if our goal was to extract names:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Input: Hello my name is Daniel\n",
        "- Output: Daniel\n",
        "\n",
        "Note:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Our inputs can be *any* kind of input string.\n",
        "* Our outputs will be fine-tuned to conform to a structured data pattern.\n",

        "::: {.callout-tip}\n",
        "## LLM Fine-tuning Mindset\n",
        "\n",
        "In LLM world, data inputs are tokens and data outputs are tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "A token is a numerical representation of some kind of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Computers like numbers (not images, text, videos, etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything must be turned into numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "And data = a very broad term.\n",
        "\n",
        "It could be text, images, video (series of images), audio, DNA sequences, Excel spreadsheets, you name it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the LLM is to be given an input sequence of tokens and then predict the following tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "So with this mindset, you can think of any problem as **tokens in, tokens out**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ask yourself: *What tokens do I want to put in and what tokens do I want my model to return?*\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, we want to put in almost any string input. And we want to get back structured information specifically related to food and drinks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This a very specific use case, however, the beauty of LLMs being so general is that you can apply this **tokens in, tokens out** mindset to almost anything.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you've got an existing dataset (no problem if you don't, you can create one, let me know if you'd like a guide on this), chances are, you can fine-tune an LLM to do pretty well on it.\n",

        "We're going to build a SLM (Small Language Model) to extract food and drink items from text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "If we needed to go over a large dataset of image captions and filter them for food items (we could then use these filtered captions for a food app).\n",

        "## Fine-tuning LLM vs RAG\n",
        "\n",
        "* Fine-tuning = To do a very specific task, e.g. structured data extraction.\n",
        "    * An example would be you're an insurance company who gets 10,000 emails a day and you want to extract structured data directly from these emails to JSON.\n",
        "* RAG = You want to inject custom knowledge into an LLM.\n",
        "    * An example would be you're an insurance company wanting to send *automatic* responses to people but you want the responses to include information from your own docs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why fine-tune your own model?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Own the model, can run on own hardware\n",
        "2. Our task is simple enough to just use a small language model\n",
        "3. No API calls needed\n",
        "4. Can run in batch mode to get much faster inference than API calls\n",
        "5. Model by default wasn't very good at our task but now since fine-tuning, is *very good*\n",
        "\n",
        "## Definitions\n",
        "\n",
        "Some quick definitions of what we're doing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Full fine-tuning** - All weights on the model are updated. Often takes longer and requires larger hardware capacity, however, if your model is small enough (e.g. 270M parameter or less), you can often do full fine-tuning.\n",
        "* **LORA fine-tuning** (also known as partial fine-tuning) - [Low Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) or training a small adapter to attach to your original model. Requires significantly less resources but [can perform on par with full fine-tuning](https://thinkingmachines.ai/blog/lora/).\n",
        "* **SLM (Small Language Model)** - A subjective definition but to me a Small Language Model is a model with under 1B parameters, with added bonus for being under 500M parameters. Less parameters generally means less performance. However, when you have a specific task, SLMs often shine because they can be tailored for that specific task. If your task is \"I want to create a chatbot capable of *anything*\", you'll generally want the biggest model you can reasonably serve. If your task is \"I want to extract some structured data from raw text inputs\", you'll probably be surprised how well a SLM can perform."
